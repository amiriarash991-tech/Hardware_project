# ✔ Final Project Summary – Hardware Troubleshooting (Beginner Level)

This project analyzes a slow Windows system to identify whether the issue is hardware-related.  
Four hardware layers were inspected: System Info, RAM, Storage, and CPU/GPU.

## 🟢 Hardware Status Summary
| Component | Result |
|-----------|---------|
| CPU | Normal performance |
| GPU | No issues detected |
| RAM | Stable, no overload |
| Storage | Healthy, no error sectors |

## 📌 Overall Conclusion
The hardware is NOT the reason for slow performance.  
The problem is likely software-related, such as:
- Startup applications consuming resources
- Background services
- Old or missing drivers
- Windows optimization required

## 🚀 Next Step Suggestion
Continue the troubleshooting in a second project focused on **software optimization and performance tuning**.

**This completes Hardware Project #1.**
