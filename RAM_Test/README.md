# 📍 02 - RAM Test

In this stage, the system memory (RAM) was inspected to ensure it is not the cause of performance slowdown.  
Monitoring memory usage helps confirm whether applications are overloading the system.

## 🧠 Evaluated Factors
- Total RAM vs. usable RAM
- Real-time usage in Task Manager
- Top memory-consuming applications
- Basic RAM stability under normal workload
